So basically think about the Resident Evil 2 Remake puzzle that involves the test tubes

The hard part about this project is the algorithm

move to all
	- Move all the values
move to limit
	- Move as many as the next variable can hold

Breadth first search might be good for this project
Keep in mind all the numbers are prime

Run through each combo, if the pair already exists, dont run through it again


Gonna try building the code in C++ first, since thats what i know

First off in my head
Im gonna code the values
I need to know what kind of data structures im going to need
